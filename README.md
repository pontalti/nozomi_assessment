# üîç Character Frequency Analyzer in Java

This repository contains two Java implementations to detect characters that appear **at least twice** in a given character array:

- ‚úÖ `CharacterFrequencySimpleVersion`: a straightforward, single-threaded version.
- üöÄ `CharacterFrequencyVTVersion`: an optimized, high-performance version leveraging **Java Virtual Threads** and concurrent processing.

## üìä Comparison: Simple vs VirtualThreads

| Feature                       | Simple Version                         | VirtualThreads Version                          |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Concurrency**              | No                                     | Yes (Virtual Threads with parallel merging)     |
| **Performance on small data**| Fast and sufficient                    | Slightly more overhead                          |
| **Performance on large data**| ‚ùå Not scalable                         | ‚úÖ Optimized for large inputs                    |
| **Thread Safety**            | Not applicable                         | Uses `ConcurrentHashMap`                        |
| **Parallelism**              | None                                   | Parallel chunk processing and merging           |
| **Error handling**           | Minimal                                | Robust with `Future.get()` handling             |
| **Output formatting**        | Raw `Set` output                       | Sorted and formatted with braces and quotes     |

## üìò Documentation Overview

### `CharacterFrequencySimpleVersion`

- ‚úÖ Easy to read and understand
- ‚úÖ Great for short input arrays
- ‚ùå Not suitable for billions of characters or CPU-intensive contexts

```java
/**
 * Counts character frequency in a single-threaded approach.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(N)
 * Space Complexity: O(K)
 * Where:
 *  N = number of characters
 *  K = number of unique characters
 */
```

### `CharacterFrequencyVTVersion`

- ‚úÖ Designed for scalability
- ‚úÖ Leverages Virtual Threads for concurrent chunk processing
- ‚úÖ Uses `ConcurrentHashMap.merge` to handle merging safely

```java
/**
 * Analyzes character frequencies using Java Virtual Threads.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(N/P + K)
 *   - N = total characters
 *   - P = available processors / threads
 *   - K = number of unique characters
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(numChunks * K_chunk + K_global)
 */
```
